1. DELETE : 
Basically, it is a Data Manipulation Language Command (DML).
It is used to delete one or more tuples of a table. 
With the help of the “DELETE” command, we can either delete all the rows in one go or can delete rows one by one. 
i.e., we can use it as per the requirement or the condition using the "Where" clause. 
It is comparatively slower than the TRUNCATE command. 
The TRUNCATE command does not remove the structure of the table.

SYNTAX – 
delete from table_name where    ;

2. DROP : 
It is a Data Definition Language Command (DDL).
It is used to drop the whole table.
With the help of the “DROP” command we can drop (delete) the whole structure in one go 
i.e. it removes the named elements of the schema.
By using this command the existence of the whole table is finished or say lost. 

SYNTAX – 
If we want to drop the table:
drop table table_name;

3. TRUNCATE : 
It is also a Data Definition Language Command (DDL).
It is used to delete all the rows of a relation (table) in one go. 
With the help of the “TRUNCATE” command, we can’t delete the single row as here WHERE clause is not used. 
By using this command the existence of all the rows of the table is lost.
It is comparatively faster than the delete command as it deletes all the rows fastly. 

SYNTAX – 
If we want to use truncate :
truncate table_name;
